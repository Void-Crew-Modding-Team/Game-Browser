Adds a button to MainMenu and EscapeMenu to show a screen with all games in the current region. You can then choose to create your own Hub or join one of the listed games.

## Tips
When in the main menu you can change regions and it will keep fetching rooms from pervious regions. (Closing and reopening the menu resets this). It will keep updating (Afaik) and you can join the room without being in the same region.

Will add to thunderstore later. Theres more changes I want to make if I can workout how first.
